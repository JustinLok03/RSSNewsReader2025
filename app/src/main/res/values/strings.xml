    <!-- Help Page -->
    <string name="help_what_is_rss">What is RSS?</string>
    <string name="help_what_is_rss_desc">RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a technology that allows you to gather and receive updates from various news websites in a standardized format. By subscribing to RSS feeds, you can stay informed and effortlessly access the latest articles from your favorite sources.\n\nRSS eliminates the need to visit multiple websites individually to check for updates. Instead, the RSS news reader app collects and organizes the content from subscribed feeds into a single place. This way, you can conveniently browse and read news articles and other updates from various sources without the need to visit each website separately.\n\nWith the app\'s RSS functionality, you can easily discover new content, personalize your news feed by selecting specific sources, and stay up to date with the latest information across different categories. The app automatically fetches and presents the newest articles from your subscribed feeds, allowing you to efficiently consume news and stay informed with just a few taps.</string>
    <string name="help_start">How to get started?</string>
    <string name="help_start_desc">To subscribe to a news source, navigate to the feed page and paste the URL to the text box under the \'Add\' tab. Once the feed is successfully extracted, the articles will be displayed in the News page if the feed is not empty.\n\nTo obtain the URL, you can look for an RSS feed on your desired website and copy the link. Alternatively, you can check if your website has an RSS feed by using the link provided on the feed page under the \'Add\' tab.\n\nHowever, if the website does not support RSS, you can visit https://rss.app to generate your own feed.</string>
    <string name="help_change_feed_language">How to change the language of a feed?</string>
    <string name="help_change_feed_language_desc">To change the language of a feed, you can go to the \'Manage\' tab on the feed page and click on the edit button. Select the desired language for the feed.\n\nNote: If you choose a language other than \'Use Language Identifier\', text-to-speech will use that language regardless of other settings.</string>
    <string name="help_wrong_language">Why is the text-to-speech speaking in the wrong language?</string>
    <string name="help_wrong_language_desc">There are a few possibilities that could have led to this issue:\n\n1. The language of the feed is incorrect. You can change the language by accessing at the \'Manage\' tab on the feed page.\n\n2. If you are using the language identifier (you can check this on the \'Manage\' tab under the feed page), the identifier may not be able to accurately detect the language of the content based on the confidence threshold you have set in the Setting page. Setting a higher confidence threshold will make it less likely for the language to be changed. For example, if the confidence threshold is set to 80% and the identifier has only 50% certainty about the language, it will result in a failure and the language will be set to English</string>
    <string name="help_offline_reading">Does the app support offline reading?</string>
    <string name="help_offline_reading_desc">Yes, the app does support offline reading. However, the articles need to be extracted in advance. You can check if an article has been extracted by clicking on it and observing whether it is in browser mode or extracted mode. Usually, subsequent articles will be automatically extracted once an article is clicked, but this process might be halted by the device to save resources.</string>
    <string name="help_reading_playing_mode">What are the \'Reading Mode\' and \'Playing Mode?\'</string>
    <string name="help_reading_playing_mode_desc">In reading mode, only the article will be displayed without text-to-speech functionality.\n\nIn playing mode, text-to-speech will start to read aloud the content of the article once it is successfully extracted.\n\nPlease note that playing mode might take longer to load as it requires time to extract and generate the text-to-speech. On the other hand, loading is faster in reading mode as it does not wait for the complete extraction of the article.</string>
    <string name="help_app_state">What are \'Save app state\' and \'Load app state\' in the navigation drawer?</string>
    <string name="help_app_state_desc">The \'Save app state\' function will export an OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) file to the storage. This file will contain the settings preferences, subscribed feeds, and articles, all of which will be written into the file.\n\nThe \'Load App State\' function allows the user to choose and import an OPML file. If the imported file contains settings preferences, feeds, and articles, the app will add them to the database.\n\nThese two functions are primarily used for transferring the settings and feeds from one phone to another.</string>
    <string name="help_bluetooth_cut_off">Why does the text-to-speech get cut off at the starting point when using Bluetooth</string>
    <string name="help_bluetooth_cut_off_desc">One of the reasons might be that some Bluetooth devices only keep the connection alive when audio is actively coming through, which is not the case with text-to-speech. As a result, the device tries to establish the connection at the starting point when text-to-speech starts speaking, causing the text-to-speech to cut off. To avoid this issue, you can try enabling background music in the Settings Page and see if it resolves the problem</string>
    <string name="help_extraction_fail">Why does my extracted article not have any content?</string>
    <string name="help_extraction_fail_desc">Some websites may require additional time for proper extraction. To allocate more time, you can visit the \'Manage\' tab on the feed page and click the reload button. Experiment with different delay times to determine the most suitable one.\n\nNote: Longer delay times will result in a longer extraction process. Please choose the shortest possible time, if applicable.</string>
    <string name="help_import_music">How can I import an audio file for background music?</string>
    <string name="help_import_music_desc">You can import an audio file on the Settings page under \'Upload background music\'. Please note that only audio files are supported, and video files are not supported. It is recommended to use the OGG format to avoid any distortion when looping.</string>
